# Bootstrap

## Install Applications

- Install brew from https://brew.sh/
- Install the applications from brew using the brewfiles:

```bash
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/common.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/macos.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/ai.Brewfile
```

Or use the helper script to auto-select by OS:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

- macOS (`Darwin`) -> `brewfiles/macos.Brewfile`
- Fedora Linux -> `brewfiles/fedora-dev.Brewfile`
- `brewfiles/common.Brewfile` is always applied first
- `brewfiles/ai.Brewfile` is applied last

- For a Fedora workstation (pure development profile), use:
  (manual alternative to `./bootstrap.sh`)

```bash
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/common.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/fedora-dev.Brewfile
brew bundle --file=brewfiles/ai.Brewfile
```

Design notes:

- Put shared tools in `brewfiles/common.Brewfile` (e.g., `fzf`).
- Put OS-specific tools in profile files (`brewfiles/macos.Brewfile` for macOS, `brewfiles/fedora-dev.Brewfile` for Fedora).
- Put AI tooling in `brewfiles/ai.Brewfile` (currently `anomalyco/tap/opencode`).
- If you want to replace a shared package later, update only `brewfiles/common.Brewfile`.

Notes:

- System utilities are managed in `brewfiles/macos.Brewfile` (currently `stats`, `hiddenbar`, and `raycast`).
- `raycast` is used as the launcher/window-management tool.
- Raycast config is stored in OneDrive; remember to back it up regularly.

### Raycast Security Scripts

This repo includes custom Raycast scripts under `raycast/scripts/`.

- `get-bitwarden-2fa.sh`: fetches TOTP from Bitwarden CLI and copies it to clipboard. It caches a BW session token in `~/Library/Caches/raycast-bitwarden-session` to reduce repeated unlock prompts.
- `lock-mac-and-bitwarden.sh`: locks Bitwarden first (`bw lock`), clears the cached session token file, then locks the Mac session.

Recommended hardening:

- In Raycast, bind your lock shortcut (for example `cmd+l`) to `lock-mac-and-bitwarden.sh` instead of the built-in Lock command.
- Keep the old lock command unbound to avoid bypassing Bitwarden lock.

## Set Up Zsh

1. Load zsh configs and plugins via:

```bash
./init.sh zsh
```

Implementation note: zsh bootstrap logic is maintained in `zsh/init.sh`, and `init.sh` only dispatches to it for the `zsh` app.

`./init.sh zsh` now:

- installs Oh My Zsh if missing (unattended)
- clones custom plugins listed in `zsh/plugins.conf` into `${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins`
- syncs plugin activation list to `~/.zsh_plugins`
- symlinks all repo `zsh/scripts/*.zsh` files into `${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}`
- symlinks repo `zsh/.zshrc` to `~/.zshrc`

To add a plugin, update only `zsh/plugins.conf` with one line per plugin:

```text
plugin-name|https://github.com/org/repo.git
```

For Oh My Zsh built-in plugins (no separate git repo), keep the URL empty:

```text
git|
```

Then rerun:

```bash
./init.sh zsh
```

This also loads `zsh/scripts/bracketed-paste.zsh`, which enables `bracketed-paste-magic` to prevent pasted commands from showing raw control prefixes like `[200~`.

## Input Method (Rime / Squirrel)

1. Install [Squirrel](https://rime.im/) via Homebrew (included in `brewfiles/macos.Brewfile`) or manually.

2. Install [rime-ice](https://github.com/iDvel/rime-ice) (雾凇拼音) using [Plum](https://github.com/rime/plum) (东风破):

```bash
# Install Plum
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/rime/plum.git plum

# Install all rime-ice files
cd ~/plum
bash rime-install iDvel/rime-ice:others/recipes/full
```

> To update rime-ice later, re-run `bash rime-install iDvel/rime-ice:others/recipes/full` from `~/plum`.

3. Overlay your saved config from OneDrive on top of the rime-ice base:

```bash
cp -r ~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/RimeSync/. ~/Library/Rime/
```

4. Reload Rime: click the Squirrel menu bar icon → **Deploy** (重新部署).

> The Rime config folder defaults to `~/Library/Rime` on macOS.

## Environment Variables

Some tools require environment variables to be set. Add them to your shell config (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or a `zsh/scripts/*.zsh` file):

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` | Copilot, OpenCode | API key for the [Context7 MCP](https://context7.com/) server |

```zsh
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

- **Copilot** reads it via `copilot/mcp-config.json` (passed as an HTTP header to the Context7 MCP endpoint).
- **OpenCode** reads it via `opencode/opencode.json` (passed to `npx @upstash/context7-mcp`).

### Load Env Vars From Bitwarden CLI (zsh)

If you use Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) to store secrets, zsh can auto-load selected values into env vars during shell startup.

1. Ensure dependencies exist:

```bash
brew install bitwarden-cli jq
```

2. Add mappings to `~/.bw-env` (one per line):

```text
# ENV_VAR|item-id-or-name|source
OPENAI_API_KEY|my-openai-key|password
GITHUB_TOKEN|gh-pat|field:token
MY_USERNAME|some-login|username
```

Supported `source` values:

- `password` (default)
- `notes`
- `username`
- `totp`
- `field:<Custom Field Name>`

3. Unlock Bitwarden vault before starting zsh (or run `bwenv` after unlocking):

```bash
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
```

4. Run `./init.sh zsh` to sync scripts, then open a new shell.

Notes:

- Loader script: `zsh/scripts/bitwarden-env.zsh`
- Default config file path: `~/.bw-env` (override with `BW_ENV_FILE`)
- Auto-load is disabled by default (`BW_ENV_AUTOLOAD=0`)
- Manual reload command in shell: `bwenv`
- Convenience command for unlock + load: `bwup`

## Configure Applications 

This repository primarily mirrors `~/.config/` and can be reused across different machines.

Link an app directory from this repo into your host's config directory:

```bash
./init.sh opencode
```

By default, this creates a symlink from `<repo>/<app>/` to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/<app>`.

Exceptions:

- `copilot` links to `~/.copilot`
- `ssh` links to `~/.ssh`

### SSH Config

SSH hosts are managed in `ssh/config` in this repository.

```bash
./init.sh ssh
```

This symlinks the repo `ssh/` directory to `~/.ssh` so host aliases (for example `testing` and `openclaw-test`) stay versioned and consistent across machines.

If the destination already exists and isn't the desired symlink, it is moved aside to `*.bak.<timestamp>`.

### Git Global Config

Manage global Git config and ignore rules from this repo:

```bash
./init.sh git
```

This creates the following symlinks:

- `git/.gitconfig` -> `~/.gitconfig`
- `git/.gitignore_global` -> `~/.gitignore_global`

Included defaults:

- enforce Unix line endings (`core.eol=lf`, `core.autocrlf=input`)
- global ignore file (`core.excludesfile=~/.gitignore_global`)
- common quality-of-life settings (`fetch.prune`, `rebase.autoStash`, `push.autoSetupRemote`, etc.)
- `git-delta` integration for paging and interactive diffs (`core.pager=delta`, `interactive.diffFilter=delta --color-only`)
- `merge.conflictStyle=zdiff3` for clearer conflict context

When you run `./init.sh git`, the script also checks whether `delta` is installed and prints a hint if missing (`brew install git-delta`).

Example: OpenCode

OpenCode configuration lives in `opencode/`.

- `opencode/AGENTS.md`: default agent instructions (copied from `~/AGENTS.md`).

## TODO

- Refactor OpenCode MCP integration to use local daemonized MCP servers (e.g., via Docker or similar), so multiple OpenCode processes can share the same running servers instead of each process starting its own.
- Keep shell environment variable loading on-demand only, so MCP-required env vars are read when needed rather than preloaded for every shell session.
